# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning models. The dataset used for training and testing comes from a credit card transaction dataset.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-fraud-detection.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset used is split into two files:
fraudTrain.csv: Training dataset
fraudTest.csv: Testing dataset
These datasets contain various features such as transaction time, amount, and more. They have been concatenated in the notebook for analysis.

## Project Structure
Data Preprocessing:
Label Encoding and Standard Scaling have been applied to handle categorical data and scale numerical features.
The dataset has been split into training and testing sets.

## Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Models Used

#### Logistic Regression:
This model predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on transaction features.

#### Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM):
A supervised learning model used for classification by finding the optimal hyperplane.

#### Results
The results of model performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which will be detailed in the notebook's final cells.
